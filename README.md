## Research problem statement
Farmers harvest apples without checking the sweetness level. They pick all apples and send them to Agricultural Products Processing Center (APC). Then a machine in APC measures their level. The problem is to harvest apples without knowing the Brix value, i.e., not checking whether it has commercial value. it is challenging for farmers to predict the optimal harvesting time based only on their experience. For consumers, it is difficult to select the best apples in terms of sugar level or sweetness.     

There are two universal ways to measure sugar levels: The destructive sugar levels measurement method (DM) and the Non-destructive sugar levels measurement method (NDM). DM measures sugar levels by testing the juice from cut fruits. It is a more affordable method than NDM. A disadvantage is that cut fruits lose their value to be sold. NDM displays sugar levels by detecting the reflected wavelength from the apples that were irradiated to near-infrared. It measures the sweetness of apples without damaging the fruits and shows the sugar levels immediately. However, the method is expensive, and the accuracy of the outputs is not stable.
